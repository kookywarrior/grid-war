# 🧩 Grid-War

A **real-time online multiplayer strategy survival game** inspired by the legendary **2048** — but with a deadly twist.  
In this chaotic grid arena, your tiles are your soldiers. When two opposing tiles meet, the **stronger one survives**, and the weaker one is destroyed.

---

## ⚔️ Game Concept

Grid-War combines the logic of **2048** with **real-time multiplayer combat**.  
Players control their own tiles on the same grid, sliding them to merge and strengthen — then clashing with others in strategic battles.  
The goal: **stay alive while eliminating every opponent**.
